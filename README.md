# Hack Rice 11 AR/VR Challenge

## Challenge Description
This challenge is an opportunity to work at the interface between computer science and reality. 
Augmented reality enhances reality through images and sounds. Virtual reality is a simulated environment people can interact with. Many aspects of our world have begun implementing both of these technologies, most notably: Snapchatâ€™s face filters. Furthermore, the COVID-19 pandemic incentivized the increased use of AR/VR technologies

## Prompt
This challenge tasks you to create an application, platform, or tool that implements augmented or virtual reality technology. Your goal should be to create something from scratch (though external libraries may be used). For the augmented reality route, you can focus on any aspect of reality (sight, sound, etc.). For the virtual reality route, you should focus on a 3-D environment. 

For the presentation, you should identify the technology you used (AR or VR), explain how your project implements the technology, problem you are addressing or the ways in which your project can be used, describe what data you used, if any, and discuss the significance and impact of your project.
